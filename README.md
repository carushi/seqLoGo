seqLoGo
=======

seqLoGo is able to extract the information of sequence logos from quite a few of sequences.

1) Base counts
2) GC contents (-gc option)
3) Compressed sequences (-str num option)

About sequence logo in the field of biology, please refer http://weblogo.berkeley.edu.

This package is useful when you would like to make sequence logos during genome-wide analysis.
Previous sequence logo software products cannot deal with too many sequences.
And seqLoGo provides reduced sequences which produce the same logo in the accuracy of (-str num).

Please type 'go get github.com/carushi/seqLoGo' and you can get a seqLoGo binary file in $GOPATH/bin.

### Future Plan

1) Write test code.
2) Produce an image of sequence logo directly.
